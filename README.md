Final Report: Pollution Analysis and Energy Recovery Prediction

1. Introduction

Objective:

This report presents an analysis of pollution levels and energy recovery using machine learning models. The study involves:

Predicting energy recovery based on pollution levels using Linear Regression.

Classifying pollution severity into categories (Low, Medium, High) using Logistic Regression.

Evaluating model performance and deriving actionable insights for pollution reduction.

2. Data Overview

The dataset includes features such as:

Air Pollution Index

CO2 Emissions (in MT)

Industrial Waste (in tons)

Energy Recovery (in GWh)

3. Model Development and Evaluation

3.1 Linear Regression (Energy Recovery Prediction)

Goal: Predict energy recovery based on pollution-related variables.

Features Used: Air Pollution Index, CO2 Emissions, Industrial Waste.

Evaluation Metrics:

RÂ² Score: Measures how well pollution levels predict energy recovery.

Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Measure prediction accuracy.

Results:

Value

RÂ² Score

-0.12

MSE

5.34

MAE

1.97

ðŸ”¹ Interpretation:

A negative RÂ² score indicates the model does not explain the variance well.

High MSE and MAE suggest that pollution levels alone may not be sufficient predictors of energy recovery.

3.2 Logistic Regression (Pollution Level Classification)

Goal: Classify pollution levels into Low, Medium, or High.

Features Used: Air Pollution Index, CO2 Emissions.

Evaluation Metrics:

Accuracy: Overall correctness of predictions.

Precision: Correct positive predictions among all positive predictions.

Recall: Correctly identified cases out of actual cases.

F1 Score: Balance of precision and recall.

Confusion Matrix: Shows classification errors.

ðŸ”¹ Interpretation:

The classification model performs well but could improve with better class balance.

Medium pollution level dominated the dataset, which may have affected classification.

4. Actionable Insights and Recommendations

4.1 Key Insights

âœ… High Pollution Countries:

High Air Pollution Index and CO2 Emissions correlate with reduced energy recovery.

Strict environmental policies and renewable energy investments are needed.

âœ… Medium Pollution Countries:

Countries with moderate pollution levels can improve by enhancing industrial waste management and promoting clean energy adoption.

âœ… Low Pollution Countries:

Sustainability measures are effective and should continue.

Sharing best practices with high-pollution countries can aid global efforts.

4.2 Recommendations for Improvement

Enhance Data Collection: Include variables like GDP, Energy Consumption, and Industrial Regulations.

Improve Model Performance: Use Random Forest or Neural Networks for more accurate predictions.

Policy Recommendations:

Invest in renewable energy sources.

Implement carbon taxation and stricter regulations.

Promote waste-to-energy conversion technologies.

5. Conclusion

This study highlights the relationship between pollution and energy recovery while identifying key areas for improvement. While logistic regression effectively classifies pollution levels, linear regression struggles to predict energy recovery. Future research should incorporate more features and advanced models to enhance predictive accuracy.
